Problem Statement : Design and Develop SQL DDL statements which demonstrate the use of SQL objects such as Table, View, Index, Sequence, Synonym.      


//CREATE A TABLE

  create table Customer(Acc_no int primary key,Name varchar(20),City varchar(15),Balance int);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.28 sec)

  desc Customer;

  insert into Customer values (1,'Ram','pune',10000);

  insert into Customer values (2,'Ravi','Nashik',25000);


  insert into Customer values (3,,,30000);



  select * from Customer;





  create table Loan(Loan_no int primary key,Name varchar(20),Loan_amt int); 


  insert into Loan values(1,'Ravi',10000);


  insert into Loan values(2,'Ram',50000);


  insert into Loan values(3,'Dipak',40000);


  select * from Loan

  SELECT DISTINCT Name as customer_name FROM Customer WHERE Name NOT IN(SELECT Name as customer_name FROM Loan);


  select distinct Name as customer_name from Customer where exists (select Name as customer_name from Loan where Customer.Name =Loan.Name); 


  Select Acc_no,Balance,Name from Customer Union Select Loan_no,Name,Loan_amt From Loan;

                             
                                    CREATE VIEW

  create view Customer_view 
   -> as select * from Customer
   -> where Balance >20000;


  select * from Customer_view;


  Create View View1 as select * from Customer where City = "Nashik" and Balance >20000;


  select * from View1;




  drop view Customer_view;




//CREATE INDEX

1) SINGLE COLUMN INDEX:
  create index ind_name on Customer(name);


3) COMPOSITE INDEX:
  create index ind on Customer(Name,Acc_no);

                                      SHOW INDEX

  show index from Customer;

                                                                         
//SEQUENCE
//Ascending order

  select * from Customer order by Balance;



//Descending order

   select * from Loan order by Loan_amt desc;


//  SYNONYM
